# openScienceAcronym
the goal is to collect the structure, coalition, company or association, who participate in the existence of Open Science.
for the beginning it deals more about open access than open science. 
the xml file should contain only the data.

the idea is that after we create a website where we the user can organize all the items, eg by type(plateform journal, repository, coalition ...), disciplines (mathematics, linguistic ...) and country for example.


As far as possible the item should be linked to wikidata, where after we can retrieve the description data
