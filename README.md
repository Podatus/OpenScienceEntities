# OpenScienceEntities
The goal is to gather some entities that help in the existence of Open Science. Currently it deals more with open access than open science. 

The underlying idea is that it lead to a website where the user can easily organize all the items, eg by type (plateform journals, repositories, coalitions ...), disciplines (mathematics, linguistic ...) or country.

The data file should only contain the data ; no format is imposed ... it is hightly human yet.
As far as possible the items should be linked to wikidata, so that after it is possible to extract the description data (eg website, country, type ...).

Of course collaborators are highly welcome, please mail me.
