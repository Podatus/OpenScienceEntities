# openScienceAcronym
the goal is to collect the structure, coalition, company or association, who participates in the existence of Open Science.
for now it deals more about open access than open science. 
the data file should contain only the data ... no format is imposed yet ... it is hightly human yet.

the idea is that after we create a website where the user can organize the items, eg by type(plateform journal, repository, coalition ...), disciplines (mathematics, linguistic ...) and country for example.


As far as possible the item should be linked to wikidata, where after we can retrieve the description data

Of course Collaborators are highly welcome, please mail me.
