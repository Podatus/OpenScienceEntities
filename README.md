# OpenScienceEntities.txt
The goal is to collect some entities thatcontributes in the existence of Open Science. Currently (2018) it deals more with open access than science. 

The underlying idea is that it leads to a website where the user can easily organize all the items, eg by type (plateform journals, repositories, coalitions ...), disciplines (mathematics, linguistic ...) or country, etc.

The data file should only contains the data ; no format is imposed yet... it is hightly human.
As far as possible the items should be linked to wikidata, so that we can extract the related data from wikidata (eg website, country, type ...).

Of course collaborators are highly welcome, please mail me.


#OAcitations.txt
some citations related to open science/access ... or related to how we can think the diffusion of reaseach outputs in our digital era.
